# Feature A Impact Analysis N26 (Spain)

This repository contains an observational data analysis assessing the impact of Feature A, launched in Spain (July 2022), on key product health metrics.

## Objective
Evaluate whether Feature A positively influences:
- Monthly Active Users (MAU)
- Primary Account Users (PAU)
- Engagement depth

## Approach
Due to the absence of a controlled experiment, the analysis uses:
- Matched cohort analysis
- Difference-in-Differences (DiD)
- Behavioral funnel decomposition

## Files
- `feature_A_analysis.ipynb`: Full Python notebook with methodology and results

## Key Takeaway
Feature A is associated with deeper engagement and higher PAU conversion, suggesting it acts as an accelerator of financial behavior rather than a simple adoption feature.

## Tools
Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
